**STF** (or Smartphone Test Farm) is a web application for debugging smartphones, smartwatches and other gadgets remotely, from the comfort of your browser.

STF was originally developed at [CyberAgent](https://www.cyberagent.co.jp/en/) to control a growing collection of more than 160 devices. As of July 2016 development is mainly sponsored by [HeadSpin](https://performance.headspin.io/) and [other individual contributors](https://opencollective.com/openstf).

We  welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/openstf).
